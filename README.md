# Data Science Work Sample Portfolio - Bianca Gunawan
This is a sample of previous Data Science projects I've worked on, fopcusing on Python for Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

## Tools
- Python: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost

## Projects
- Racial Bias in Deep Learning Image Recognition: Explored the impact of more diverse data sets on model performancet to evaluate the existence of racial bias of different models given same data.
- Loan Predicition with Machine Learning: Complete data analysis, feature engineering, and comparison of various machine learnings models built for loan rate prediction.
- Clustering Exercise with Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering exercises with K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering
- Sentiment Analysis of U.S. Airlines from X/Twitter: Identified major sentiments towards various U.S. Airlines from X/Twitter data to create marketing strategy recommendations
- [Exploratory Data Analysis of Fitness Center Data](https://github.com/biancagunawan/Portfolio/blob/f2c07beb473c7b587dc71e89f2357f8b34ecc744/Fitness%20Center%20EDA.ipynb)
