# Data Science Work Sample Portfolio - Bianca Gunawan
This is a sample of previous Data Science projects I've worked on, fopcusing on Python for Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

## Tools
- Python: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost

## Projects
- [End-to-End Analytics: Powering the Future of LOL Entertainment](https://github.com/biancagunawan/Portfolio/blob/99755b6786c4ce59a19624c7228b6844862fb1c3/End-to-End%20Analytics%20Capstone%20Project.pdf): A Capstone Project partering with LOL Entertainment to create Cloud Database Infrastructure in BigQuery of the museum's ticketing and marketing data, and build automated and dynamic Google Looker reporting dashboard.
