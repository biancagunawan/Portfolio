This is a sample of previous Data Science and Analytics projects I've worked on, specifically in Python and SQL.

## Tools
- Python: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost

## Projects
- Racial Bias in Deep Learning Image Recognition: Explored the impact of more diverse data sets on model performancet to evaluate the existence of racial bias of different models given same data.
- Loan Predicition with Machine Learning: Complete data analysis, feature engineering, and comparison of various machine learnings models built for loan rate prediction.
- Clustering Exercise with Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering exercises with K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering
